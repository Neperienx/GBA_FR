The Goal of this project is to do a LUA automation for Pokemon Fire red french edition. 
The main goal will be to automate the game, form load up, to catching shiny pokemons. 
Features will have to include:
1. finding a grass area.
2. checking if we have an encounter
3. check of pokemon is shiny
4. if shiny wait for user input
5. if not shiny battle pokemon for exp (we need a pp management system)
6. repeat until a shiny is found or we are out of pp.
7. if out of pp we have to go back to the nearest pokecenter and heal.
8. repeat by walking back to grass
